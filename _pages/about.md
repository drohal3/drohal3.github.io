I am a software engineer with a strong passion for developing cloud-based IoT data systems. My journey began during my time at the University of Helsinki, where I joined a university spin-off project, IdealAQ, at the Institute for Atmospheric and Earth System Research. Initially brought on to support software development, I quickly became involved in designing and implementing configurable control software for scientific measurement devices.

Over time, I led the development of an IoT platform that collects data from a variety of devices and sensors, stores it securely in the cloud, and visualizes it in a user-friendly web application. My Masterâ€™s thesis explored the challenges of storing and managing large-scale IoT data, including the analysis of various solutions to optimize performance and scalability.
