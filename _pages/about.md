I am a software engineer with a strong passion for developing cloud-based IoT data systems. My journey began during my time at the University of Helsinki, where I joined a university spin-off project, IdealAQ, at the Institute for Atmospheric and Earth System Research. Initially brought on to support software development, I quickly became involved in designing and implementing configurable control software for scientific measurement devices.

Over time, I led the development of an IoT platform that collects data from a variety of devices and sensors, stores it securely in the cloud, and visualizes it in a user-friendly web application. My Master’s thesis explored the challenges of storing and managing large-scale IoT data, including the analysis of various solutions to optimize performance and scalability.

My career has recently taken a new direction, focusing on cloud, IoT and modern web development. My journey began with learning Java and C++ during my studies at the University of Zilina in Slovakia, where mastering these languages was essential for completing my coursework. While pursuing my bachelor’s degree, I also worked part-time as a web developer at a local company, primarily using PHP and JavaScript, with occasional projects in C++.

I moved to Finland for a double-degree program, which awarded me a second bachelor’s degree from JAMK University of Applied Sciences. During my time at JAMK, I completed a practical training placement with Solteq Oyj, where I was later hired. At Solteq, I continued specializing in web development, working in a team responsible for developing and maintaining Magento 2 (now Adobe Commerce) projects for prominent Finnish and international clients.

In my free time, I enjoy traveling and playing board games with friends.
